doctrine.code
=============

Lazy code wrapper with editing support, and planned analysis and highlighting
support.

As of right now, the ``Code()`` class only provides a lazy API to a text file,
with methods for inserting and deleting text, splitting and joining lines etc.

In the future the Code object will also provide cached highlighting and
other code analysis functions.
